I'm currently feeling confused and redundant in my planning, but here's my objective: I have two integrated tracks for a productive year that will overlap in certain areas. I would appreciate your assistance in combining these tracks into 1 track and planning it in detail, breaking it down into weekly tasks that I can easily add to my calendar. If necessary, please further subdivide these tasks for clarity.

**Track 1 - Learning Priorities:**

1. **Learn React JS, Git, and SQL** (15 weeks)

   - Focus on mastering key concepts and practical applications in front-end development, version control, and database management.

2. **Learn DevOps, Azure AZ-204, FastAPI, and Python** (6 months)

   - Emphasize the integration of development and operations, cloud services on Azure, and building applications using FastAPI and Python.

3. **Learn Russian** (1 year)

   - Dedicate time each week to language acquisition, including vocabulary, grammar, and conversational practice.

**Track 2 - Project Priorities:**

1. **Deliver Weekly Features for Live Projects**

   - I have three active projects—SalsaTD, Salsasegura, and WODCard—and I aim to implement and deliver new features weekly while simultaneously advancing my IT skills outlined in Track 1.

2. **Commit to Year-long Learning Initiatives**

   - This will involve not just technical skills, but also project management, effective communication, and agile methodologies.

**Constraints:**

1. I consider myself a slow reader, writer, and typist, which may require me to allocate extra time for each learning module and task to ensure I fully grasp the material.

2. As I work full-time, time management will be crucial in balancing my professional responsibilities with my learning and project commitments.

**Additional Information:**

- The **DASHBOARD.md** file will be the single source of truth for tracking my progress and keeping all relevant information organized.

- Please consider the most effective way to compile information about each of my projects when using Copilot for updates; this will help streamline my workflow and ensure I stay on track.

- Lastly, I will need to clean up any extraneous and redundant files to maintain an organized workspace.

I look forward to your guidance and support in making this year as productive and fulfilling as possible!
